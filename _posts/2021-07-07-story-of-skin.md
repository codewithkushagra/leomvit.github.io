**STORY OF SKIN**  

I have skin.
The skin that carries my story,
The story of my scars, 
The story of my tans,
Some scars they fade away with time but some don't, they remain forever
But the pain of each and every scar fades with time no matter how deep it is, pain will eventually be gone
And with time you get comfortable in your scarred skin that becomes part of your story 
The people around, who truly and deeply understand you, will accept your scars and will never make you feel any different.
Now, the scar is fresh it will hurt  
But time will take away the pain I know one day 
Maybe someday
Now, the scar is old, 
I am looking at my skin, 
I saw the scar that once used to be fresh and used to hurt
Now, it's just a humble reminder that I have grown stronger and acceptance is the way I live
One day I died, 
All my skin emerged with something unknown and then all the story that I made is forgotten 
It is forgotten NOW.
